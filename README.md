# Logparsers and its using in log mining
Intelligent DevOps assignment

## Log Parser analysis 
Adding more algorithms to analyse the performance on the 5 dataset mentioned
- Log pasers : https://github.com/logpai/logparser
- Dataset : https://github.com/logpai/loghub
1. Moses - SLCT + ?
2. Aurel - IPLoM + Drain
3. Bhagya - LKE + LFA + spell + logmine
4. Patrick - LogSig + ?

## Log mining techniques
Here we will try all the log mining techniques mentioned in the main paper that needs to be replicated ("An evaluation study on log
parsing and its use in log mining.") 

## Timeline

Sep 29 - Oct 6 : all of us will present how our 3 parser algorithms working with the mining algorithms !
 - the parsing algorithms
 - the machine learning algorithms
 - the performance comparison
 - and the best things and worst things that you like about the two parser techniques
 
 Oct 7 - Oct 13 : 
 
 Impromptu: If the NBC data is available we have to add the strategies for analysing it
 
 we will compare the results in between ourselves
 - also suggest one research question that you think that can improve the performance of the algorithms you have been working with
 - Also make sure that you are writing the report along side, so that we can concatenate them in the end
 
 Oct 14 - 20  finalise power point , and presentation techniques
 Oct 20 -24 Report
